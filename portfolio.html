                <p>
                Missing Persons is constructed through the collection and consideration of photographs sourced from 
                the State Library of Victoria. The work responds critically to the cataloging and naming practices adopted 
                by the State Library. Missing Persons reframes these practices as an imposed, white ontology of ‘normative’ 
                citizenry. This ontology is supported institutionally, through the use of a taxonomy of ‘othering’, applied at 
                will to those not immediately identifiable as Anglo-European. <br><br>

                Images in the State Libary’s digital collection that contained one of four specific search phrases* in 
                their title.  1456 photographs have been collected. The four phrases were chosen due to the absence of any 
                nominal, ethnic, or cultural adjective. As such, they collectively constitute an implicit construction of ‘a 
                normative person’ by the State Library. The collected images have been used as a dataset to train a generative 
                adversarial network, that produces portraits of new, artificial ‘normative’ citizens. <br><br>

                Missing Persons problematizes the unspoken whiteness of these normative categories as a regime of white 
                privilege. Questioning the thresholds and complexities of the ‘artificial’ and the interlaced role archival 
                institutions play in the construction of social histories.  <br> <br>

                    Constructed from images of both objects made & found, Copy For Your Information acts as an ongoing private -> public 
                    archival interface. <br><br>

                    The genesis of each image-object in the collection, can be indexed to an original non-fungible physical 
                    image-object held within the artist's private collection. From these physical image-objects, a 
                    'New-Digital-Image' is created using a flatbed scanner. <br> <br>
                    
                    Copy For Your Information manifests as the digital equivalent pairing to the physical image-object. 
                    Non-fungible and indexable. The work makes a provocation that any further 'reproductions' of the images 
                    held within the collection, should be considered a "copy for your information". <br> <br>

                        Ten minutes and another truck crawls its way past, delivering supplies to the concrete manufacturer 
                        across the road. As the sun speeds towards the horizon, the procession of cars and utes laden with 
                        fishing equipment becomes more frequent - their journey ends at the end of the road by the river, 
                        which is now some 400m east of where it once lay, displaced, seemingly without a trace.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        COLLIDER began to retrace the First Ecologies of the Maribyrnong and Birrarung river systems in an 
                        effort to unlearn and question our settler/occupier histories. In doing so, we found enormous acts 
                        of violence committed against the First Ecologies of these systems hiding in plain sight; expertly 
                        forgotten. Like so many aspects of colonisation, the everlasting and irreversible effects on these 
                        systems are disturbingly quiet and largely unquestioned. In 1879, John Coode recommended a series 
                        of alterations to the Maribyrnong and Birrarung rivers. The Maribyrnong was deconstructed and 
                        re-routed to prevent the frequent and necessary flooding of the area. Once a vast wetland, the 
                        area is now host to concrete factories, oil storage facilities and a sugar processing port. The 
                        activity of industry silences the echoes of a once thriving natural ecosystem. A destructive event, 
                        on a scale so large it’s almost unimaginable in the minds of settlers/occupiers.
                        <br><br>
                        In response to the discovery of this unseen marker of violence and colonisation, COLLIDER sought to 
                        return the water to its original place. The collective has produced a series of performative 
                        photographic works through returning water from the reconstructed bank of Maribyrnong to various 
                        First Sites of the river, that have since been destroyed. A small gesture we hope makes visible the 
                        extent of the far reaching damage caused by colonisation; past, present, and ongoing.

                    This paper explores the relationship between vernacular photographs and photographic / art discourse, in an attempt to understand why vernaculars are excluded from photographic conversations, yet included within art practice when used as found objects. This will be investigated through looking at the existing conditions within photographic discourse, and through an exploration into what conditions could be met in order to understand vernacular photography’s inclusion within a larger artistic discourse.
